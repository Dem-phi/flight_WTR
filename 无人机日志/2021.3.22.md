## pose control

#### problem 1: roslaunch px4.launch  file Error

reason:

1.yaw estimate error			

2.TX_Message queue overflow 

solution:

1.restart  Pixhawk or Plug in and out realsense t265

2.cannot write a while loop in ros::Duration() function, otherwise, it's will cause the frequency  too high and overflow in the queue.

#### problem 2: UAV cannot reach the target and complete all procedure instantly

reason:

1.When judging the error, the negative number appears in the "if( x || y || z )" judgment sentence. That will cause the whole judgment sentence false.

solution:

1.#include "math.h" and use abs() function

#### problem 3: realsense t265 face down, data drift

reason:

1.t265 data drift and cause the UAV flying forward.

solution:

1.let t265 face slant down

2.because of the function of gyroscope, z coordinate is still pointing up, so we do not need to transform the xyz axis

## tips

1.first testing, we can set z coordinate small(0.5m), but do not set smaller than 0.3m

2.connect the contact wire of each module firmly

3.we plan to nest velocity controller to pose controller.
