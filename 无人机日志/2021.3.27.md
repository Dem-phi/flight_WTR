## velocity control 

#### problem 1: PID control 

reason:

1.Wrong position of variable assignment statement

2.Increment PID control has some uncertain problems.(it's still in the exploration)

solution:

1.we choose to use positional PID controller.

#### problem 2: rcCallback

reason:

1.Because the button(SB) of position has not changed, so when entering the velocity mode, it will immediately return to pose mode.

solution:

1.Disabled rcCallback function after UAV change to pose mode firstly.



## single position control

#### problem 1: t265 vision callback 

reason:

1.t265 data drift sometimes, and it will cause serious consequences.

solution:

1.Change the contact wire between t265 and manifold.

2.continue to solve ...
